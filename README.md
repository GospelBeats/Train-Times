# Train-Times

https://gospelbeats.github.io/Train-Times/

This application uses Firebase as a backend database to receive data and update data on the database. This application also uses moment.js to format dates and times throughout the program. The end user enters the train name, destination, first train time, and frequency, and the program will display the next arrival time and the how many minutes away is the next train.
